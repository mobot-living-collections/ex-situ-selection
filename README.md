# ex-situ-selection
R code associated with Martin et al.'s "Measuring demographic stochasticity and selection due to attrition in ex-situ collections for plant conservation"

These scripts are part of a project on provenance selection and opportunity for selection in ex-situ collections for plant conservation. The project uses as a study system a living collection of Quercus arkansana (Fagaceae) maintained in the Oertli Hardy Plant Nursery of the Missouri Botanical Garden.
